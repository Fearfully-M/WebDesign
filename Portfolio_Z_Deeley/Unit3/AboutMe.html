<h1>About Me</h1>
<body>

  <p>My name is Zachery Deeley. I was born August 10, 2006. I have lived in Tazewell County all my life. My dad is retired from the coal mines and my mom is a travel nurse. I have 1 older brother that graduated from Virgina Tech. I have a dog named Zoe, 2 cats, and a cockatiel that can sing. I wanted to take the web design class because i enjoy working with computers. I especially like to play Roblox and upload youtube videos. I am currently doing virtual classes because of COVID-19. After graduation I would like to do something that involves working with computers. I hope this class helps me become more computer literate.</p>
